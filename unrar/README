### Build steps for Release:
> make # for nacl
> make VALID_TOOLCHAINS=pnacl # for pnacl

Add "Release" keyword to "data-configs" attribute in index.html to use Release
executables (for now only debug executables are used). 

To run using pnacl, modify "data-tools" attribute in index.html to point to
pnacl as first argument.

### Use:
- load unpacked extension and open rar / zip archives

### Debugging:
> make debug

To see debug messages open chrome from a terminal and check the output.
For output redirection see
